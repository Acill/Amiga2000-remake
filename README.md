# Amiga2000-remake

A recreation of the Amiga2000 motherboard using Sprint Layout

I started with the complete removal of all components of an Amiga2000 rev 6.2 motherboard. I than removed all the print and 
the green layer so the bare copper showed.
The motherboard was than scanned at 600 dpi on both sides (saved as jpeg) which than could be loaded in Sprint Layout 6.0.

In Sprint Layout I than placed all the components (the ones that weren't there I created myself).
Then I put in all the via's.

I am now busy with tracing all the connections with the scans as background.

Update 31-5-2019

Frontside finished (I think). When the solderside is finished I will check both sides completely before sending the files of for fabrication.

Solderside finished.
I checked both sides in close up. (took all day). I found a view missing ground connections and i think it is okay.

I will check it again in a view days.

If people want to check it also be my guest but keep me informed if you find anything. (preferably with a screenshot).
